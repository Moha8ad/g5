Expand Your Vocabulary and Learn New Words

G5 is an interactive app designed to help users expand their vocabulary and learn new words. With a user-friendly interface and intuitive features, G5 makes the process of learning words engaging and enjoyable. G5 offers an effective and systematic approach to learning new words. With its incremental learning system and helpful features, you can enhance your vocabulary and language skills. Please note that G5 represents one of my early attempts and may not reflect my current skills, but it still provides a valuable tool for expanding your knowledge and improving your vocabulary.

## Features:

- Word Input: Add new words along with their meanings and examples using the input fields.
- Incremental Learning: Each day, the app guides you to learn a new word and add it to your vocabulary.
- Progressive Learning: The new word progresses through five boxes, representing different stages of mastery. If you know a word, you move it to the next box. Otherwise, it remains in the current box for further practice.
- Archive Box: Once a word reaches the fifth box and you confirm your mastery, it moves to the archive box, signifying your successful acquisition.
- Example Highlighting: When viewing a word in the archive box, the app automatically highlights the word in the example sentence for easy identification.
- Word Details: Hovering over a highlighted word reveals its meaning, and clicking and holding allows you to see the full definition.
- Desktop Design: The app is designed for desktop use, providing a comfortable learning experience on larger screens.
